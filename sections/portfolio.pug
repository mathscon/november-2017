              p Listed by the Science Council as ‘one of UK’s top 100 Scientists’, Dr. Nira Chamberlain is indeed one of the greatest mathematical minds the present world has seen. He is the first mathematician who has made into the list of “Top 100 Britain’s most influential people of African and African-Caribbean Heritage”.

              p Completing his PhD in Statistical Physics from Portsmouth University, Dr. Chamberlain went on to become a Fellow of the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications, the Chartered Scientist, as well as the Chartered Mathematician.

              p Dr. Chamberlain has over 20 years of experience at writing mathematical models/simulation algorithms that solve complex industrial problems. He develops mathematical solutions within industries such as the defence, aerospace, automotive and energy sectors! No wonder he is one of the few British Mathematicians to feature in the Encyclopedia of Mathematics & Society.

              p In 2017 , Dr Nira Chamberlain became one of the Vice-Presidents of the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications.

              p Nira’s multi-dimensional excellence in the field of Mathematics has no bounds. His recommendation to any aspiring mathematician is that “You don’t need anybody’s permission to be a great mathematician!”

              p We are proud to have him as one of our keynote speakers this year. You cannot afford to miss this one of the most influential mathematical voices in the upcoming edition of Mathscon.

                p Manchester based mathematician, Dr. Katie Steckles, after finishing her PhD in 2011, has gained a global recognition by choosing to be one of the most influential female mathematics and science communicators in the world. She talks about maths in schools, at science festivals, on BBC radio, at music festivals, as part of theatre shows and on the internet.

                p Katie, besides being a Mathematics Masterclass speaker for the Royal Institution, works for Think Maths giving talks in schools around the country about engaging off-curriculum mathematics.

                p Dr. Steckles has appeared in several videos on the YouTube channel Numberphile; is the organiser of the Manchester branch of MathsJam, a monthly pub night which involves fun maths, puzzles and other interesting mathsy things; is the organiser of Manchester Girl Geeks, the Manchester branch of the world famous Girl Geek Dinners.

                p These are just a few of the outstanding outreach and engaging activities Dr. Katie Steckles does, in the capacity of her wonderful mathematically enriched career.

                p Katie was awarded the prestigious Joshua Phillips Award for Innovation in Science Engagement in 2016.

                p When she’s not doing some serious mathematical project, she enjoys doing puzzles, solving the Rubik's cube and baking things of geometrically significant shapes!

                p Mathscon 2018 is thrilled to have you, Katie
